## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/saksham-shrey/UrbanServicePlatform.git
```

2. Open the project in Xcode:

```
cd UrbanServicePlatform
open UrbanServicePlatform.xcodeproj
```
or if using CocoaPods for Firebase SDK then, 
``` 
open UrbanServicePlatform.xcworkspace
```
3. Install CocoaPods dependencies (if using CocoaPods - I have used Swift Package Manager for the Firebase iOS SDK):

```
pod install
```

4. Configure Firebase:
   - Follow [Firebase Setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) to set up your Firebase project and download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.
   - Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to your Xcode project. (Or just use the .plist I have provided, just don't abuse it please.)

5. Build and run the project in Xcode.

## Dependencies

- **SwiftUI**: A modern UI framework for building user interfaces across all Apple platforms.
- **Firebase**: A comprehensive backend platform that includes authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and more.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your iOS device or simulator.
2. Sign up or log in using your credentials.
3. Consumers can post services and view their posted services.
4. Workers can browse posted services and place bids on those they are interested in.
5. Consumers can review and accept bids from workers.
6. Workers can track all posted services, including those theyâ€™ve bid on and those where their bid has been accepted.

## Architecture Features 

- **Real-Time Updates**: Optimize the app for real-time updates to avoid delays in service postings and bidding.
- **Network Connectivity**: Requires a stable internet connection for interacting with Firebase services.
